# startup-application
For my startup application, I amd going to build off the prompt of a voting platform, and make a game-site similar to the "Who's that Pokemon?" segment on TV. The main concept is a page with an image of a pokemon, and four options for the type of pokemon that the user can choose from. After they have made a choice, they will be shown how other people voted, as well as which option is the correct answer. Depending on complexity, I would like to have the image of the pokemon start blacked out with a solid color, and then slowly fade to show all the details. Users would log in after a prompt from a "Professor Tree" and their responses would be saved in order to show to other users. Again depending on complexity, I would like to have several different "guesses" with users able access past prompts and have new ones generated every so often (concept image is for daily prompts but could be any frequency).
